## SUMMARY

Machine Learning Engineer specializing in computer vision systems for robotics and real-world deployment. Experienced in building and operating end-to-end ML systems, from data and training pipelines to edge deployment and continuous retraining, across large robot fleets.

Proven track record of improving model performance, reliability, and scalability in production environments, with strong experience in PyTorch, distributed training, and ML infrastructure.

## EXPERIENCE

**Freelance ML Consultant** - *Remote | 2025 - Present*  
&nbsp;*Machine Learning Consultant - US AgTech client (vertical farming)*

- Led transfer and reimplementation of ML systems from a robotics startup, ensuring uninterrupted robotic crop harvesting operations.
- Rebuilt MLOps pipelines for training, evaluation, and deployment, enabling fully automated retraining and zero-touch production releases.
- Reimplemented YOLOv3 in PyTorch with optimized inference pipeline, achieving 10x throughput improvement and eliminating licensing constraints for cost-free deployment.

**Maui63** - *Remote, NZ | 2021 - Present*  
&nbsp;*Software & ML Volunteer*  

- Designed a similarity-based anomaly detection pipeline using DINOv3 embeddings to surface out-of-distribution marine objects, prioritizing high-value samples for labeling and reducing manual review effort.
- Trained and evaluated transformer-based object detection models (RF-DETR) for marine wildlife detection across diverse aerial datasets.
- Built custom labeling and post-processing tools (OpenCV, YOLO) to support efficient annotation and dataset curation workflows.

**Tortuga Agtech** - *Remote, UK-USA | 2021 - 2025*  
&nbsp;*Machine Learning & Computer Vision Engineer (2023 - 2025)*  

- Established the first production-grade end-to-end distributed ML infrastructure (PyTorch, Ray, Lightning, MLflow, Airflow), enabling ML and field engineers to iterate and deploy models independently.
- Managed 9 concurrent ML workflows (e.g., detection, segmentation, classification) for robotic strawberry harvesting, implementing automated monitoring and retraining on incoming data streams.
- Defined roadmaps and managed labeling priorities, while mentoring ops staff on data projects and coordinating internal and external annotation teams.
- Migrated labeling workflows to a self-hosted CVAT instance and new providers, reducing annotation costs by 50%+.    

&nbsp;*MLOps Engineer (2022 - 2023)*  

- Acted as de facto technical lead for ML infrastructure, supporting both research iteration and production deployment across teams.
- Built robust deployment infrastructure allowing ML artifacts to be reliably deployed to over 150 field robots operating with intermittent connectivity.
- Unified training-inference interfaces for all deployed ML models, enabling faster iteration and reducing duplication across teams.
- Overhauled on-robot ML interfaces (Python & ROS), including implementing comprehensive testing frameworks that ensured seamless and reliable model deployments to the field.
- Architected CI/CD pipelines for ML models, integrating automated testing and gradual rollout strategies to prevent field regressions.

&nbsp;*Robotics Engineer (2021 - 2022)*  

- Sole UK-based robotics engineer; provided field support and GMT coverage.
- Troubleshot field-deployed robots across hardware and software systems, from manipulation to ML performance.
- Developed visualization and ML infrastructure (Docker, Plotly, AWS).

**Earlier Experience**  

- Mechanical Engineer, TWD (*London, UK | 2018 - 2019*) - Designed maritime equipment and developed internal Python tools for structural analysis.  

- Simulation Project, Tata Steel (*IJmuiden, NL | 2017*) - Developed a real-time thermal simulation proof-of-concept reducing mean estimation error by 83%; later deployed to production.
