## EXPERIENCE

**Freelance ML Consultant** - *Remote | 2025 - Present*  
&nbsp;*Machine Learning Consultant - AgTech client (vertical farming)*

- Led the transfer of ML intellectual property from a robotics startup, ensuring business continuity for robotic crop harvesting.  
- Advised on Computer Vision strategy and roadmap for autonomous harvesting systems.  
- Rebuilt MLOps pipelines for automated training, evaluation, and deployment across multiple ML projects, enabling the client to run fully automated retraining and deployment without manual intervention.

**Tortuga Agtech** - *Remote, UK-USA | 2021 - 2025*  
&nbsp;*Machine Learning & Computer Vision Engineer (2023 - 2025)*  

- Designed end-to-end ML infrastructure, allowing ML and field engineers to iterate and deploy models independently.  
- Defined roadmaps and managed priorities for labeling, while mentoring ops staff and coordinating internal and external annotation teams.  
- Scaled model training from single-GPU experiments to distributed training (Ray & PyTorch Lightning) while ensuring backward compatibility across diverse tasks (detection, classification, segmentation).  
- Migrated labeling workflows to CVAT and new providers, reducing annotation costs by 50%+.    

&nbsp;*MLOps Engineer (2022 - 2023)*  

- Unified training-inference interfaces for all deployed ML models enabling faster iteration and reducing duplication across teams.  
- Overhauled on-robot ML interfaces (Python & ROS), including implementing testing frameworks, allowing for seamless and reliable model deployments to the field.  
- Built new end-to-end ML pipelines for robotics projects in production.  

&nbsp;*Robotics Engineer (2021 - 2022)*  

- Sole UK-based robotics engineer; provided field deployment and GMT coverage.  
- Developed visualization and ML infrastructure (Docker, Plotly, AWS).  

**Maui63** - *Remote, NZ | 2021*  
&nbsp;*Software & ML Volunteer*  

- Built OpenCV/YOLOv4-based labeling and post-processing tools for marine mammal monitoring.  

**Earlier Experience**  

- Mechanical Engineer, TWD (*London, UK | 2018 - 2019*) - designed maritime equipment and developed internal Python tools for structural analysis.
