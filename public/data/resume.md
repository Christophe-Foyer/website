## EXPERIENCE

**Freelance ML Consultant** - *Remote | 2025 - Present*  
&nbsp;*Machine Learning Consultant - US AgTech client (vertical farming)*

- Handled the transfer of ML intellectual property from a robotics startup, ensuring business continuity for robotic crop harvesting spinning up an entirely new ML project and deploying it on custom infrastructure within the first week of the contract.  
- Rebuilt MLOps pipelines for automated training, evaluation, and deployment across multiple ML projects, enabling the client to run fully automated retraining and deployment without manual intervention.
- Reimplemented YOLOv3 in PyTorch, achieving a 10x improvement in inference throughput and avoiding licensing dependencies, enabling cost-free deployment across client platforms.
- Evaluated RF-DETR as a high-fidelity replacement to Detectron2, improving mAP by 4%.

**Maui63** - *Remote, NZ | 2021-Present*  
&nbsp;*Software & ML Volunteer*  

- Training RF-DETR models for highly accurate object detection of marine wildlife in diverse aerial datasets.
- Developing an anomaly detection pipeline using DINOv3 embeddings to automatically identify and surface unusual objects for targeted annotation, significantly reducing human labeling effort.
- Built OpenCV/YOLOv4-based labeling and post-processing tools used for marine mammal monitoring. 

**Tortuga Agtech** - *Remote, UK-USA | 2021 - 2025*  
&nbsp;*Machine Learning & Computer Vision Engineer (2023 - 2025)*  

- Designed and hosted a self-contained, end-to-end ML infrastructure utilizing PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, MLflow, and Airflow, enabling ML and field engineers to iterate and deploy models independently.
- Managed 9 distinct ML paradigms concurrently, establishing automated monitoring and retraining loops on new data streams.
- Defined roadmaps and managed priorities for labeling, while mentoring ops staff and coordinating internal and external annotation teams.  
- Scaled model training from single-GPU experiments to distributed training (Ray & PyTorch Lightning) while ensuring backward compatibility across diverse tasks (detection, classification, segmentation).  
- Migrated labeling workflows to CVAT and new providers, reducing annotation costs by 50%+.    

&nbsp;*MLOps Engineer (2022 - 2023)*  

- Built robust deployment infrastructure allowing ML artifacts to be reliably deployed to over 150 field robots operating in austere networking environments.  
- Unified training-inference interfaces for all deployed ML models, enabling faster iteration and reducing duplication across teams.  
- Overhauled on-robot ML interfaces (Python & ROS), including implementing comprehensive testing frameworks that ensured seamless and reliable model deployments to the field.  
- Designed new automated end-to-end ML pipelines for robotics projects, bringing models from raw data to full production deployment.
- Architected CI/CD pipelines for ML models, integrating automated testing and gradual rollout strategies to prevent field regressions.  

&nbsp;*Robotics Engineer (2021 - 2022)*  

- Sole UK-based robotics engineer; provided field deployment and GMT coverage.  
- Troubleshooting of field-deployed robots, including hardware and software issues, from manipulation to ML performance.  
- Developed visualization and ML infrastructure (Docker, Plotly, AWS).  

**Earlier Experience**  

- Mechanical Engineer, TWD (*London, UK | 2018 - 2019*) - designed maritime equipment and developed internal Python tools for structural analysis.  

- Software Project, Tata Steel (*IJmuiden, NL | 2017*) - real-time thermal simulation proof-of-concept reducing mean estimation error by 83%, the project was later deployed in production.
